# `serename` is no longer maintained

The `serename` script was abandoned in favour of
[`rename`](http://plasmasturm.org/code/rename) as well as
[`pipe-rename`](https://github.com/marcusbuffett/pipe-rename).

```sh
# The following lines produce equivalent results:
rename 's/a/b/' *
serename 's/a/b/' *
